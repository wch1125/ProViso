Reason through a problem without taking any action.

## Purpose

Use this when you need to:
- Analyze a tricky problem
- Consider multiple approaches
- Think through implications before committing
- Understand why something is broken

## Process

1. **Restate the problem** — Make sure you understand it
2. **Gather relevant context** — Read related code/files
3. **Consider options** — List possible approaches
4. **Analyze tradeoffs** — Pros/cons of each
5. **Recommend** — What you'd do and why

## Output Format

```
## Thinking: {Problem Summary}

### Understanding
{Restate the problem in your own words}

### Relevant Context
{What you found in the code/files that matters}

### Options Considered

**Option A: {Name}**
- Approach: {description}
- Pros: {benefits}
- Cons: {drawbacks}

**Option B: {Name}**
- Approach: {description}

- Cons: {drawbacks}

{Add more options as needed}

### Recommendation
{Which option and why}

### Questions

- Do NOT run commands
- Just think and analyze
